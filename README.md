# Coderunner

Coderunner is a simple side project for my own education. My initial goal is to run code in an isolated environment, with future plans to potentially evolve into a platform similar to LeetCode, where users can run code against test cases.

## Features
- Run code in Docker containers for isolation and security

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go (latest version recommended)
- Docker installed and running
- Required Docker images for supported runtimes (ensure images are available locally)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/3cognito/coderunner.git>
   cd coderunner
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Usage
To start the project, run:
```bash
go run .
```

API documentation will be added as the project evolves.
